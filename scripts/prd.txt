# Pygame Asteroid Game Enhancements PRD

## 1. Overview
Enhance the existing Pygame asteroid game with new asteroid types, a player health system, and more nuanced collision mechanics.

## 2. Goals
- Increase gameplay variety and challenge.
- Introduce a health system for survivability.
- Implement risk/reward based on different asteroid types.

## 3. Features

### 3.1 New Asteroid Assets
- Load 7 new asteroid images named `a0.png` through `a6.png` located in `assets/images/asteroid/`.

### 3.2 Weighted Asteroid Spawning
- Modify the asteroid spawning logic.
- Asteroid `a0` should spawn most frequently.
- Spawn frequency should decrease progressively, making `a6` the rarest.

### 3.3 Variable Asteroid Sizes & Danger
- Asteroids should spawn with different sizes (e.g., small, medium, large).
- Asteroid `a0` can spawn in all available sizes.
- As the asteroid number increases (from 1 to 6), the available size options should decrease.
- Asteroid `a6` should only spawn in the smallest 1 or 2 size options, signifying high danger despite its small size.

### 3.4 Player Health System
- Implement a health attribute for the player ship (e.g., start with 100 health points).
- Display the player's current health on the screen.

### 3.5 Asteroid Damage Levels
- Define a damage value for each asteroid type when it collides with the player.
- Asteroid `a0` should inflict minimal damage.
- Damage should increase progressively with the asteroid number, making `a6` inflict the most damage (potentially lethal in one hit or requiring very few hits).

### 3.6 Collision Damage
- Update the collision detection system between the player and asteroids.
- When a collision occurs, decrease the player's health based on the colliding asteroid's damage value (from Feature 3.5).

### 3.7 Player Death Condition
- Implement a condition to check the player's health.
- If player health drops to 0 or below, trigger a game over state or destroy the player ship.

## 4. Non-Goals
- Adding new weapons.
- Changing ship movement mechanics (unless required for health display).
- Online multiplayer.
